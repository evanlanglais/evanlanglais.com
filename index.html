        </header>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                A UConn graduate living and working in NYC, I've been programming and tinkering with computers and technology since the age of 11.
                I have a passion for creating things.
            </p>
            <p>
                I became a sole proprietor under the name of Treehouse Technologies in the year 2012 as a
                freshman in highschool, playing around with various aspects of tech such as video game development,
                server hosting, system building, and ultimately freelance software development. That passion for
                computers eventually led me to major in the Computer Science Field.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of tech, I enjoy creating music and videos, learning new things, and petting dogs.

                        HUE is a simple color matching game that was in development for the better part of the last two years, starting as a spiritual successor from a different original game called Occasionally Blue.
                        The player uses the full screen to intuitivly select a color that is compared against a set of shapes randomly drawn on the screen utilizing the Delta-E 2000 algorithm.

                        The senior design project as part of UConn's engineering curriculum. The problem / request came from a Connecticut company which installs and maintains Kohler generators.

                        Led a team of 6 academic peers to fulfill client requirement of allowing technicians to view data of, and send commands to, an existing infrastructure of over 7000 generators throughout the northeast, via a web app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I became the project's lead architect, and after reading IOT and big-data white papers provided by our academic advisor
                        I planned a five stage pipeline which would theoretically allow a full rollout of retrofitting the 7000+ generators, fully supporting the amount of data processing that would be associated with it.
                        To implement the project, the team worked together to plan all necessary tasks, those tasks' dependencies, and estimated amount of work. Together, we were able to create a fully working prototype several weeks before UConn's Demo Day 2019.

                    <ol>
                        <li>Attaching a Raspberry Pi to the generator's computer, running a Go app to communicate via the MODBUS protocol to read sensor data and change generator settings. Data was packaged into efficient structures via Arvo and sent to gateway server</li>
                        <li>The Go gateway server/router served several purposes, the main two being 1) keeping tabs on generator uptime by issuing heartbeats and 2) route incoming data packages to the processing pipeline and outgoing commands to the proper generator connection</li>
                        <li>The processing pipeline started with a Kafka cluster to ensure scalability, and data was consumed via a Scala app that would spun up in a Spark cluster. The Scala app would unpack the data and transform the input into time-series data, POSTing that to an OpenTSDB database</li>
                        <li>An express.js REST API was utilized to return generator inventory from MariaDB and their respective statuses from the gateway server, sensor time-series data, and relay commands back to the generator</li>
                        <li>An Angular web-app provided a dashboard for a technician to log in, view the health of all generators they have permission to view, and visualize sensor data over time utilizing chart.js</li>

                        Treehouse Technologies was originally founded by myself and two friends with a wildly
                        ambitious vision of building video games to compete with AAA game studios. After the other
                        two founding members left, I registered Treehouse Technologies as a sole proprietorship in
                        my freshman year of high-school. From that point, the Treehouse Technologies brand became
                        one of self and business experimentation--constantly exploring new technology and business ventures.

                    <p>
                        I credit most of the problem solving and programming skills that I use today (both personally
                        and professionally) to be a result of the creative experimentation that Treehouse Technologies enabled.
